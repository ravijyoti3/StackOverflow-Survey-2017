# StackOverflow-Survey-2017
I have used data from StackOverflow 2017 Annual Developers Survey, to get a closer look at the questions. This survey conducted on many developers and contains over 64,000 reviews, from all over the world.

# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?
2. What are the programming languages used by developers and which are in demand by industries.
3. How salary plays a role in job satisfaction of a developer.

# File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@ravijyoti3/what-developers-have-to-say-c6499c07fe8d).
